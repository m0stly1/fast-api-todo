# fast-api-todo
Todo application built with FastAPI, MySQL and Docker.
Note: Using hot-reload in this project so it's not suitable for prod

## todo(in the project itself)
- ~~create db with docker-compose~~
- ~~create table and some data~~
- db connection
- endpoints
- service layer
- env file
- testing
- logs would be cool?
