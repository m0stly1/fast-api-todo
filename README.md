# fast-api-todo
Todo application built with FastAPI, MySQL and Docker.
Note: Using hot-reload in this project so it's not suitable for prod.
For Macbook M1 add platform: linux/x86_64 in docker-compose.yml at db, mysql tends to fight

## todo(in the project itself)
- ~~create db with docker-compose~~
- ~~create table and some data~~
- ~~db connection~~
- ~~endpoints~~
- ~~service layer~~
- env file
- testing
- fix reponses
- logs would be cool?
